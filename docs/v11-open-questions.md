# Historical v11 review notes

Status: historical and non-normative. This file records the state of the
superseded v11 development branch. Keep Vault v12 neither implements nor reads
v11 and no release decision may be based on this document. Current macOS v12
requirements live in `KEEP_VAULT_V12_MACOS_RELEASE.md`.

Everything here was found or raised while v11 was being built and deliberately
not fixed. Each entry says what is wrong, why it was left, and what would close
it.

## 1. The two signing keys shared one wrapping key

RSA-PSS/SHA-512 and ML-DSA-87 are algorithmically independent, and a release is
only trusted when both verify. Operationally they are not independent: both
private halves are protected by the same 32-byte AES key held in one Keychain
item. Whoever obtains that key obtains both halves, and the hybrid signature
stops being a hybrid at exactly the moment it would matter.

This was not fixed in v11 because re-wrapping requires the plaintext ML-DSA key, which
exists only on the offline backup medium — the migration cannot be done from a
build machine that only has the envelopes.

The v12 release gate requires two Keychain items with independent random keys, one per
algorithm; `Protect-HybridKeys-macOS.sh` creates both; the signer reads each
half through its own item. Two prompts per release, which is already the
accepted behaviour. Better still, two different holders — a smartcard or HSM
for at least the RSA half — so that no single machine ever has both.

## 2. The v11 ZPAQ child process was not separately sandboxed

ZPAQ already runs as an external process, not in-process: `ZpaqService` starts a
trust-verified executable and talks to it over pipes. What it does not have is a
sandbox profile of its own. The parser is a large native C++ codebase and the
largest remaining attack surface in the program, and it is fenced in — path
validation, no symlinks, private input snapshots, size limits, a malformed-input
corpus, bounded output, cancellation that kills the whole process tree — but a
memory-safety bug in it would still execute with the same rights as the app that
launched it, which include the user's files and the Keychain items above.

The recorded remediation was to launch the child under a restrictive sandbox profile, with file
access limited to the private snapshot and one output directory, and no network.
The interface is already a pipe, so this is a launch change rather than a
rewrite.

## 3. v11 was not notarized and used an Apple Development identity

Gatekeeper refuses the app on any Mac other than the one that built it. This is
a distribution problem, not a cryptographic one — the hybrid signature and the
dual manifests are what actually establish what the package is — but it makes
the published build awkward to install.

The recorded remediation was a Developer ID Application certificate and a notarization
submission in the release build. It needs a paid Apple Developer account;
nothing in the code has to change.

## 4. The PMI is observable locally even though it is not stored

The Argon2id memory cost is derived from the credentials and never written to
the header or to KPAR2. That keeps it off disk. It does not hide it from a
process watching this one: resident set size and elapsed time both track it, so
a local observer can estimate the PMI of a derivation it watches, and 16 bits of
memory profile is a small space to search.

This is documented rather than fixed because the alternative — a constant memory
cost — gives the same information away to everyone unconditionally. Whether the
variable cost earns its complexity is still open.

## 5. The XOR combiner in the role key schedule

Each role key is the XOR of an HKDF-HMAC-SHA3-512 output and a keyed
Skein-MAC-1024-1024 output. This combines two 1024-bit PRF outputs into one
under the assumption that both families behave as assumed and the contexts are
unique. It is not a robust combiner: two primitives that fail in correlated
ways, or a maliciously chosen pair, are not covered. The claim in the code and
in the documentation is deliberately narrow and should stay narrow.

## 6. Both Argon2id branches share BLAKE2b

The SHA3 branch and the Skein branch differ in what they are fed and in their
domains, not in their core. Argon2id is Argon2id on both sides, so a structural
break in Argon2's compression function affects both. Calling the two branches
"independent" is only true of their inputs.

## 7. Windows

`KalynaArchiver` has been carried along to v11 as source. It compiles — the
project builds on macOS with `-p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true`, which is how the
v11 changes to the Windows-only code paths were checked — but it has never been
*run* or tested on Windows. In particular the Windows ZPAQ input snapshot
(`WindowsInputSnapshot` in `ZpaqService.cs`) and its adversarial regression
matrix have only been compiled, never executed. Either run the Windows test
suite on Windows or state plainly that the Windows tree is unsupported.
