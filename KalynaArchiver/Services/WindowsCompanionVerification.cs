/// <remarks>
/// The scanner reads the QR codes off the printed key sheets, so it handles the
/// two secret factors. It is a separate application that shares no code with
/// Keep Vault and cannot check itself: an app that verifies its own signature
/// proves nothing to anyone who has already replaced it. Keep Vault checks it
/// instead, against the same six compiled key fingerprints it holds itself.
///
/// A failure here does not stop Keep Vault. The scanner is a separate program
/// and Keep Vault never loads its code; the honest response is to say so
/// loudly, not to refuse to archive anything.
///
/// The same arrangement as the macOS build's MacCompanionVerification, over the
/// Windows layout: an executable beside Keep Vault or in a QR-Scanner folder
/// next to it, with its detached hybrid signature as a sidecar.
