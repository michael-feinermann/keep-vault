// That is not a preference. AVCaptureMetadataOutput reads machine-readable
// codes on iOS only; on macOS the same class offers face metadata and nothing
// else, so .qr never appears among its available types and it silently never
// reports a code. It is an easy mistake to make, because the class exists on
// macOS, compiles against .qr, and simply never fires.
//
// Vision's barcode request works on macOS and gives what the arbiter needs
// anyway: every code in the frame, each with its own payload and its own
// position, so two printed codes can be told apart from one code seen twice.
